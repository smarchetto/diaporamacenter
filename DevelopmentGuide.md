DiaporamaCenter is a Win32 application developed with Embarcardero Delphi 2009.

This application uses the [ComPort library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/comport/) to control videoprojectors through a COM port.
The original source code has been slightly changed to integrate into DiaporamaCenter. The modified source code can be found in the source repository, in the `components` sub folder.
